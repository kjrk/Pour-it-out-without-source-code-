# Pour It Out (Without Source Code) - Kelvin Kwok


## Inspiration
Most drinking games requires you to read a question and answer OR take a sip of your drink. The idea of reversing the concept where answering the question is mandatory gives the people playing, a different feel and excitement. The concept of the game requires the participant to answer the question THEN they can either choose whether to reveal the question or NOT.
